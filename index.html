    <hr3> <em>Is Feminism the New Toxicity</em></hr3>
<p>Most People Ask me "Are you a Feminist'? especially when I talk about Women, What runs through their minds is this "she is one of those that doesn't have cultural values" or "she is one of those, who literally as no regard for anyone". But really, do I blame them? NOPE! 
 </p>
 <p> I did some research and I observed some things about some ladies who call themselves "FEMINIST".
 </p>
 <ol>
<li> They don't know "JACK" about it</li>
    <li>There are some set of ladies, who feel losing their cultural values is being objective.</li>
     <li> There are some sets of people who just love the way that word sounds and just wanna sound intellectual{ this one is not intellectual at all lol}
        
     </li>
     <li>some just wanna speak up for women but say it in the wrong way, which is perceived by other people as nonsense. lol

     </li>
     <li>finally, some have this deep knowledge of what feminism is all about, but they are scared of being dragged by those I listed above. lol

     </li>
 </ol>
  <p>Now, I ask you my dear millennials,<em>is Feminism now the new Toxicity?</em></p> 
  <p> I understand we want to stand up for our rights, we are the "Soro-Soke" generation, but we are gradually losing our cultural values.
</p>
<p>I know you must be wondering what cultural values are losing.</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
    <li>
        This generation is grossly entitled- no one is seeing their faults anymore, we are so concerned about our neighbor's faults.

        <ul>
            <li>we talk about feminism with the idea of "if my husband can't do some certain things, I am leaving the marriage"

            </li>
            <li>we no longer want things to be private, we make SM the new judge Judy. lol!</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

</ol>
<ol start="2">
    <li>
        someone even said, she not gonna kneel for her husband, LMAO!
        <ul>
            <li>We don't want to be submissive wives anymore. we say our parents don't have SM which is why their marriage lasted long.
                
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
 <p>We don't want to be submissive wives anymore. we say our parents don't have SM which is why their marriage lasted long.
    </p>
<p>We wanna be Woke so bad forgetting, Marriage also means being submissive to one another.
And I can go on and on, I asked someone why his marriage collapsed he said "we grew apart"
   we now hide under the guise of feminism to be disrespectful to elders and hostile to strangers. </p>
   <p>I am not saying, we should absorb all these crazy letdowns and Sexist kinds of people, I am saying we can still be feminists and NOT LOOSE OUR CULTURAL VALUES. We can take our time to learn what it is all about.

   </p>
   <p>For example, you are in an organization the same as a man, doing the same job as him, Damn it!!! you deserve equal pay! There are many things we ought to stand up for, Girls are being abused every day and our problem is why we shouldn't kneel. Losing our cultural values should be the least. 

   </p>
   <p>Now, do you as if I am a <a href="https://twitter.com/LegendaryEnergy/status/1573588460559945728?s=20&t=OnUtQ3Lal_e8p4CdvBwmCQ">FEMINIST</a> Of course, I AM.</p>
   <p>I know my ass is gonna burn so bad for this, well I can take the heat. LOL!</p>
   <p>I want to know, what your thoughts are in the comment section.</p>
